REFLECTION
1.Structures are used to make our code compact.
in this workshop i used 2 structures one for storing information regarding game and 
another for storing player details.
Structures are used to store any type of data structures inside them.
struct PlayerInfo
{
    char character_symbol;
    int number_of_lives;
    int Treasure;
    int Player_History[Max_length];
};

// declaring structure 2 for game info

struct GameInfo
{
    int path_length;
    int number_of_moves;
    int Bomb_location[Max_length];
    int Treasure_location[Max_length];
};

We can even use these integers or arrays normally as they are used inside the code.





2.In that case there would be 2 parallel arrays if we stored the games played.In  storing array
we could have stored the games played inside that and used it along side the code.




3.I spent most of my time in figuring out the code requiring the previous output to be saved and input the next input and 
present all the saved outputs simultaneously.
To overcome this i placed that part in loop and applied logic and saved every input into the variaiables and with the help of nested for loops 
arrays i made my code.
