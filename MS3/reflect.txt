ans1. The three functions created are:-
     void viewAppointments(struct ClinicData* data)In this function data inside structure will be taken as arguments.Purpose of using this function is 
        to display list of patient's appointments. This will will display appointments and their time and date at which ther are scheduled.
       and patient details as well including thier number,name .User can view,reschedule and book their appointments using this function.
     

     Void addAppointment(struct Appointment *appointments, int maxAppointments, struct Patient *patients, int maxPatient)-This function 
is used to add appointments, if number of patients allowed are not full then it would propmt user to scehedule appointment and ask for 
deatils like name, number, preffered time.


    sortingAppoint(appointments, size)-This function would display the appointments scheduled in ascending order of their date and time
for which they are booked.

ans2 I used 90 to 100 lines for addAppointment function, because using this i didnt needed to code the repetitive steps happening.
By adding few methods of pattern recognisation into different functions. 

checkLeapYear(&appointments[size].date)-This function is to check the time that is taken from addAppointment functions and if they are 
and checks if the value isvalid, if it is not valid it displays error and ask user to enter another time. Also for date it checks if the
year is leap then it sets the date accordingly in Feburary.

basically size(quantity)=calculateSizeOfAppointmentsArray(appointments, maxAppointments)-This function checks if there is vacancy in appointment
for new appointment. This is realy very important to ensure proper completion of code, so that there is a limit  to the 
number of appointments.

ans3 I planned my milestone 3 in a very systematic way. As i had other projects too, i used to di code at night. Firstly i went through the codes
and the additional functions that were required to be added, i understoodbhem and made them. Then i analyzed the four files core.c clini.c 
core.h clinic.h and created a projrct for them and placed contents in them and rearranged my code. I placed initializaTtion of functio in header 
files , then included those files whereever it was asked in c files. Still my  code was not proper then i realized there are 2 txt files 
that are needed to be included then i copied the data and made two files patientData and appointmentData and placed along with the 5 files
inside project file and then ran the code and it included the 20 patients and 15 appointment deatils.
